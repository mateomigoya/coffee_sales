# Using Microsoft Excel to Handle and Visualize Coffee Sales Data

## Project Overview

This project is designed to showcase proficiency in Microsoft Excel using essential Excel functions, creating data and pivot tables, and developing a visually appealing dashboard that contains various adjustable filters and charts.

## Project Data

To create this dashboard, an .xlsx file containing data on the store's sales was used. However, as shown by the file "coffeeOrdersData.xlsx", the first sheet contained some missing elements, thus some important Excel functions were needed in order to deal with this attrition in data. In particular, "XLOOKUP" and "INDEX MATCH" were used to popullate the missing cells using data from the other sheets. A simple multiplication formula along with several "IF" functions were used in addition to this. I then used various data and number formatting techniques, checked for duplicates, and converted the range to a data table.

## Dashboard Creation

Once the data table was made, I was then able to create pivot tables with the necessary variables for the elements of the dashboard, which include a timeline, three slicers, and some charts. The ultimate intention of this dashboard was to have all of these elements capable of working together in unison, where the timeline and slicers could be adjusted as desired, consequently updating the charts. You can interact with the dashboard by observing the "coffee_sales_final.xlsx" file.

## Conclusion

To conclude, this project has equipped me with the knowledge to take advantage of the robust data handling functionalities of Excel along with the development of interactive and visually appealling dashboards that conveniently connect with the data.
